These files are automatically generated by Copilot using the SBV code generator backend.

To build, you will need to ensure that all external variables and triggers are visible.
Also, modify driver.c to include a main() function.
Also, modify copilot_stdint.h to include your own definition of uint 8, 16, 32, 64 and int 8, 16, 32, 64.
Once you have a valid C program, execute

  > make driver

Modify the Makefile rules (Makefile and copilot.mk) as you see fit.
